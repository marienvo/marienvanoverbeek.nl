## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of my Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/          # GitHub Actions
â”œâ”€â”€ content/          # Content files shared between Astro site and PDF
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cv.json       # CV content (ðŸš¨ always test PDF ðŸš¨)
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           # Static assets, like images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cv.pdf        # Generated PDF (recruiters like this)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/          # scripts for building/watching other stuff than Astro
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # All React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/      # All page layouts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/        # All pages of the site
â”œâ”€â”€ bun.lockb         # Lockfile for bun ðŸš€
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is
exposed as a route based on its file name.
