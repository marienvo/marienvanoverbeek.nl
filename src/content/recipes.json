Popular among vegetarians and vegans across Europe, it is often served with pasta for dinner. Oat cream adds a smooth texture, keeping the dish entirely plant-based yet satisfying.",

        "intro": "Roasting spices enhances their flavors by releasing essential oils, creating deeper, more complex aromas. This is a common practice in various cuisines, especially in South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mexican dishes, where freshly roasted and ground spice blends are key to authentic flavor. Roasting is typically done over medium heat in a dry pan to avoid burning. It requires close attention since over-roasting can result in bitterness.\n\nOnce roasted and cooled, spices are often ground and used in masalas, rubs, or blends for curries, stews, and marinades.",
        "content": "When you roast spices (also known as toasting), you intensify their flavors and develop subtler, deeper aromas. Here's more detailed information on how to roast different spices and tips on doing it right:\n\n## **Cinnamon**\n\n- **Good for roasting:** Yes, both cinnamon sticks and ground cinnamon.\n- **Heat level:** Medium, about 300°F (150°C).\n- **Time:** 2-4 minutes for ground cinnamon; sticks may take a bit longer, about 5-7 minutes.\n- **Note:** You'll smell the cinnamon as soon as it releases its aroma; that's the sign it's roasted enough. Over-roasting can cause bitterness.\n\n## **Star Anise**\n\n- **Good for roasting:** Yes.\n- **Heat level:** Medium, about 300-320°F (150-160°C).\n- **Time:** 2-3 minutes.\n- **Note:** Star anise burns easily, so keep a close watch. Its aroma will become intense, but roasting too long can make the flavor too sharp.\n\n## **Coriander Seeds**\n\n- **Good for roasting:** Yes, ideal for roasting.\n- **Heat level:** Medium, 320-340°F (160-170°C).\n- **Time:** 3-5 minutes.\n- **Note:** Once you start smelling a nutty aroma, the seeds are ready. Remove them from heat quickly to prevent burning.\n\n## **Cumin Seeds**\n\n- **Good for roasting:** Yes.\n- **Heat level:** Medium, around 320°F (160°C).\n- **Time:** 2-4 minutes.\n- **Note:** The seeds will start popping when done. If they turn dark brown, you've roasted them too long.\n\n## **Cloves**\n\n- **Good for roasting:** Yes.\n- **Heat level:** Low to medium, around 280-300°F (140-150°C).\n- **Time:** 2-3 minutes.\n- **Note:** Cloves have a strong aroma, so don't over-roast them, as excessive heat can make the flavor harsh.\n\n## **Cardamom**\n\n- **Good for roasting:** Yes, especially whole pods.\n- **Heat level:** Medium, around 320°F (160°C).\n- **Time:** 2-3 minutes.\n- **Note:** You'll notice the pods change color slightly and release a fragrance. Grind them immediately after roasting for the best flavor.\n\n## General Tips:\n\n- **Heat:** Use a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat (or an oven at 300-340°F / 150-170°C). A dry skillet works best—no oil needed.\n- **Time:** Depends on the spice, but usually between 2-5 minutes. Stay close and stir or shake the pan regularly.\n- **Too short?** If you don't smell the spice's aroma clearly, it's not done.\n- **Too long?** If the spices start smoking or turning black, they've been roasted too long and might taste bitter.\n- **Let it cool.** After roasting, let the spices cool before grinding them. This helps the flavors blend well and become more nuanced.\n\n\n",

Roasted squash and aromatics are blended with oat cream and tahini, creating a rich, plant-based creaminess. Popular autumnal spices like rosemary, thyme, nutmeg, and cinnamon add depth.\n\nPaired pasta shapes like mafaldine, campanelle, or radiatori are chosen for their ability to hold sauces, maximizing flavor in each bite.

Fun and a bit less common!\n- Campanelle – Resembling little flowers or horns, this shape lets the sauce settle nicely in its rolled edges. It looks festive on the plate!\n- Fusilli lunghi – Essentially long fusilli (spiral pasta) with a playful twist. The curls hold the sauce well, and it looks impressive.\n- Radiatori – As the name suggests, this pasta looks like mini radiators! The ridges are perfect for a thick sauce like pumpkin puree, and the size makes each bite flavorful.\n- Strozzapreti – These short, twisted pastas look like little rolls.

This cashew-based sauce serves as a counterpart to spinach gorgonzola, offering a plant-based alternative that uses nutritional yeast to replicate the savory, umami-rich qualities of cheese. Combined with oat cream and mustard, it creates a creamy consistency and tang, making it ideal for pasta dishes. This sauce pairs well with pasta shapes like fusilli, rigatoni, mafaldine, or farfalle, which effectively capture its smooth, rich texture.",
        "content": "- Sauce prep (2 portions)\n\t- 100 g raw, unsalted cashews (not roasted or fried)\n\t- 125 ml oat cream\n\t- 1 cup nutritional yeast (nooch)\n\t- 2-3 tablespoon mustard (Dijon or whole grain, to taste)\n\t- 🧊 Keep in freezer for up to 3 months\n- Cook (p.p.)\n\t- 1 clove garlic\n\t- 250 g spinach\n\t- lime juice (fresh, prefer not to freeze)\n\t- Salt to taste (at least a pinch)\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Soak the cashews in water for at least 4 hours (or overnight). This softens them, making them easier to blend into a creamy sauce.\n2. Drain the cashews and place them in a food processor.\n3. Add the oat cream, nutritional yeast, mustard, and (optional) garlic clove.\n4. Blend everything until smooth and creamy. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of water to reach the desired consistency.\n5. Heat up in a pan with the spinach, some lemon juice for freshness, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n6. Add the cooked pasta, and serve\n\n### Pasta Shapes\n\n- Fusilli: The twisted shape holds onto the sauce well, making sure each bite is loaded with flavor.\n- Rigatoni: Large, ridged tubes that are perfect for creamy sauces like this one.\n- Mafaldine: The ruffled edges of this long pasta work great for catching the sauce, and it looks festive on the plate.\n- Farfalle: Butterfly-shaped pasta adds a fun variation and surprisingly holds the sauce well in its folds.\n\n\n",
