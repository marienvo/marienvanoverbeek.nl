Spinach, introduced to Italian cuisine in the Middle Ages, brings a fresh, earthy touch, while walnuts add crunch.

A sprinkle of Parmigiano Reggiano completes the flavors, making it popular in modern Italian and international kitchens.",

The name \"arrabbiata\" means \"angry\" in Italian, referring to the fiery and spicy flavor of the sauce. Traditionally, this dish is served without cheese, to preserve the boldness of the spicy tomato sauce. It exemplifies the Italian culinary philosophy of using a few ingredients to create a dish with strong, distinct flavors.",

Lentils, unlike meat, can become too soft if cooked too long, making this dish a quicker alternative. Popular among vegetarians and vegans across Europe, it is often served with pasta for dinner. Oat cream adds a smooth texture, keeping the dish entirely plant-based yet satisfying.",
